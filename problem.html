				<div class="flex-row">
					<p>Mexcio’s water crisis has been a prevalent issue for a long time, Mexico’s Government released and advertising campaign in 2010 titled “The City My Run Out of Water” and this statement still holds true. Even though Mexico has an abundance of rainwater this resource is not properly utilized. 70% of the city’s water source comes from aquifer’s that are not able to reliably refill compared to its depletion, due to rainwater being stopped by asphalt and concrete. <br>_<br>
						Not only is the city running out of water both for drinking and agriculture, but the water crisis is also causing the city to sink at an alarming rate of 30 cm/year. As groundwater is being pumped out, the underground water levels sinks causing the mix of volcanic soil and clay that the city is built on to sink unevenly, resulting in the entire city being uneven. The city’s sidewalks are uneven and buildings are leaning, and this will only get worse as the city’s groundwater gets depleted.
